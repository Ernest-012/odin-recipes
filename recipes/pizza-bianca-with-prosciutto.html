                <h2>Pizza-Bianca-with-Prosciutto </h2>

                <h2>Description</h2>
                    Grilling pizza allows for a beautiful crisp crust, and this pizza bianca with mozzarella and prosciutto will also be
                    finished before most pizzerias could deliver.

                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 pound prepared pizza dough</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
                    <li>1/3 cup ricotta cheese</li>
                    <li>1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
                    <li>1 pinch salt</li>
                    <li>6 (2 ounce) pieces fresh mozzarella</li>
                    <li>3 slices prosciutto, roughly torn</li>
                    <li>2 large basil leaves, roughly torn</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Directions</h2>

                <h3>Step 1</h3>
                    Preheat a gas grill with all burners on High for 10 to 15 minutes.

                <h3>Step 2</h3>
                    Shape pizza dough into an 8 to 10-inch disc. Brush dough with olive oil.

                <h3>Step 3</h3>
                    Reduce the flame on half the grill burners to Low, to create areas of direct and indirect heat.

                <h3>Step 4</h3>
                    Carefully place dough onto the grill over direct heat. Close the cover. Grill dough until bottom is just barely cooked
                    and shows char marks, 1 to 3 minutes.

                <h3>Step 5</h3>
                    Turn crust ninety degrees (do not flip dough over). Grill until crust shows light grill marks, 1 to 3 minutes.

                <h3>Step 6</h3>
                    Carefully remove par-grilled dough from the grill. Spread ricotta over dough; sprinkle with salt and Italian seasoning.
                    Place cheese on top, add prosciutto evenly over cheese.
                
                <h3>Step 7</h3>
                    Return pizza to the grill over indirect heat; grill until cheese is melted, about 3 minutes. Carefully remove pizza from
                    the grill.
                
                <h3>Step 8</h3>
                    Preheat the ovenâ€™s broiler.
                
                <h3>Step 9</h3>
                    Broil pizza until cheese is golden, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle torn basil on top of pizza. Allow pizza to rest for a few
                    minutes before cutting into wedges.
